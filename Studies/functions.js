/**
 *
 * Function:
 *
 * 1. The two phases of using function: first, we must ___? Next, we can execute (or two other
 * words for executing a function?) a function by?
 *
 * 2. What's the difference between a functions parameters and arguments Passed to a function?
 *
 * 3. What's the syntax for a named function?
 *
 * 4. How do we assign to a function to a variable?
 *
 * 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we
 * specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
 *
 * 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse
 * is not true.
 *
 * 7. Closures: Functions form closures around data they house. If an object returned from the
 * function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays alive, and
 * data can continue to exist in these closures.
